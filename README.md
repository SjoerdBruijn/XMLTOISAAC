# XMLTOISAAC
Tool to get from XML with your pubs to the NWO ISAAC system.
The idea is to load an xml with your pubs at the top, and fill them in the ISAAC system, so that  you dont have to do this manually.

If you're in the biomedical domain, you may want to use pubmedtoisaac, which grabs data from pubmed. 

You'll need to install biopython and selenium. Once I am well enough of a Python nerd, I hope that I can make this into a less "you-need-to-be-able-to-program-in-python-to-use-this" kind of thing, but hey.. my time is limited, and I need to submit to ISAAC only once a year... ;-). 

Still in development, so there may be bugs. 
Any collab on this is welcome.

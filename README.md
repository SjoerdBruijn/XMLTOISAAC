# XMLTOISAAC
Tool to get from XML with your pubs to the NWO ISAAC system. 
The idea is to load an xml with your pubs at the top, and fill them in the ISAAC system, so that  you dont have to do this manually. Right now, all the code does is login to ISAAC and navigate to the proper pages. From there on, things should be filled (stopped working there). Also, the loading of your pubs from an xml still has to happen. 

Still in development, early baby steps. 
Any collab on this is welcome.

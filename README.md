# XMLTOISAAC
Tool to get from XML with your pubs to the NWO ISAAC system. 
The idea is to load an xml with your pubs at the top, and fill them in the ISAAC system, so that  you dont have to do this manually.

Still in development, so there may be bugs. KNOWN PROBLEM: DOI is not imported 
Any collab on this is welcome.
